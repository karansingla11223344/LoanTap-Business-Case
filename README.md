LoanTap provides personal loans to customers and faces the critical challenge of identifying borrowers who are likely to default versus those who will fully repay their loans. Incorrect classification can lead to financial losses or missed business opportunities.

In this business case, we aim to build a classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a loan applicant will default or repay the loan based on historical customer and loan-related features. The objective is to help the business make data-driven lending decisions and minimize credit risk.
